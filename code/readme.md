# Code for the lecture

In this folder you can find a tutorial on Jupyter notebook `NotebookTutorial.ipynb`. To install it you can follow the guidelines here [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install). You need to have Python already installed. The easiest way to install Python and the notebook is with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

The demo notebooks can be run online on Binder by clicking on the small icon [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bricaud/PatternRecognition/HEAD).
The notebooks can also be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You just need to have a Google account. Colab provides access to GPUs, they are not necessary for the Pattern Recognition course but they may be useful if you want to explore further in the direction of deep learning.

The file `pretrained_features.ipynb` is a demo notebook explaining how to generate some features from images. It loads a pre-trained network from the TensorFlow library (TensorFlow Hub). A new set of images (Flowers pictures) is fed into the network and the ouput of one of the inner layers of this network is collected. The ouput serves as features representing each image. This notebook is inspired from this [Google Colab example](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_image_retraining). It is recommanded to run it using Colab or your local machine. Binder has troubles with TensorFlow.
